            <p id="introduction2">
                I hope to become an intern, or junior software or web dev, after completing 6 months of a coding bootcamp with Codespace. I have extensive research, academic, practical, and teaching experience, from different fields, which I wish to incorporate into my goal of becoming an innovative and creative programmer.
